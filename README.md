# SegFormer-tf

This repository is about an implementation of the research paper "SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers"

SegFormer is a Transformer-based framework for semantic segmentation that unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders.

# Usage:

Clone Github Repo: 

```bash
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/IMvision12/SegFormer-tf
$ cd SegFormer-tf
```

Then import model
```
import tensorflow as tf
from models import SegFormer_B3
model = SegFormer_B3(input_shape = (224, 224, 3), num_classes = 19)
print(model.summary())
```
